Steps to run my code :- 

1. Install node modules using "npm i" command.

2. After installation of node modules give the command "npm start" to start my application.


Note:- 
        After starting the application it may take few seconds to show the data
        because I used "json-server" to store the data and deployed it in "render" so that even after refreshing the page the data will not be disappeared. 

        So I request you to wait for a few seconds to see the data and functionalities.
